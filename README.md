# TempoNN
This was my class project for the spring 2018 class "Music, Body, and Brain." My full write up is in the .docx file, but it was an attempt to replicate the results of this blogpost: https://nlml.github.io/neural-networks/detecting-bpm-neural-networks-update/ 

If I was to try this again, I would try incorporating LSTMs, due to tempo's... temporal nature. This would have the goal of outputting the tempo directly, because I still don't know what autocorrelation is. 

Note: Requires a "Songs" folder with .wav files whose names start with the songs tempo. This didn't end up working, so I'm not going to bother.
